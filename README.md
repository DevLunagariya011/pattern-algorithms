# Pattern Algorithms

This repository contains original mathematical and algorithmic approaches to
classic pattern and array problems.

Topics included:
- Printing right triangles using triangular numbers (single loop)
- Concentric square patterns using diagonal decomposition

These ideas were independently derived and documented to show how mathematical
structures can simplify programming problems.
